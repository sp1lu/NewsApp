## ðŸ”° About
Simple rss reader capable of showing the latest news from rss sources and custom subreddits.

The app is able to save user preferences in a MongoDB database so that everyone can use the application even on different devices without losing their feed sources.

The project was born with the intention of developing something customized after having followed the [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course by [Colt Steele](https://github.com/Colt) without creating yet another version of the famous YelpCamp project developed during the course.
